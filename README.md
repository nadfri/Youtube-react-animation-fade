# Animated Modal Close Effect

This project demonstrates how to create a smooth close animation for a modal in React using TypeScript and CSS transitions.

## Features

- Modern, accessible modal component
- Smooth fade and slide close animation
- Clean and readable code structure
- Customizable styles to fit your theme

## How it works

When the modal is closed, a CSS animation is triggered before the modal is removed from the DOM, providing a visually pleasing transition instead of an abrupt disappearance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`)
4. Click the "Open Modal" button to see the modal and its close animation
